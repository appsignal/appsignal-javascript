# AppSignal for JavaScript changelog

## 1.6.1

_Published on 2025-09-30._

### Added

- Allow functions as backtrace matchers. Alongside regular expressions, you can also provide custom functions to match and replace paths in the backtrace:

  ```javascript
  const appsignal = new Appsignal({
    // ...
    matchBacktracePaths: [(path) => {
      if (path.indexOf("/bundle/") !== -1) {
        return "bundle.js"
      }
    }]
  })
  ```

  The function must take a backtrace line path as an argument. When the function returns a non-empty string, the string will be used as the path for that backtrace line. Otherwise, the path will be left unchanged.

  (patch [eae2ad4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/eae2ad46e68f3359eb50480ba95ded6badddf8bf))

### Fixed

- Fix matching on backtrace paths containing spaces.

  When using `matchBacktracePaths`, when a backtrace line path contains a space, it will now match correctly against the whole path.

  (patch [51783cb](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/51783cbb716b2c9c4a81055b8f9a573080b73104))

## 1.6.0

_Published on 2025-07-21._

### Added

- Add getters for spans. Use the `getAction`, `getNamespace`, `getError`, `getTags`, `getParams`, `getBreadcrumbs`, and `getEnvironment` methods to access data about the current span. This can be used to make decisions based on the span's properties within decorators or overrides. (patch [892fff5](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/892fff5a3d4368a1d9d81813a952de0c5e76d36a))
- Allow overrides to ignore spans. Within an override function, returning `false` will cause AppSignal to ignore the span. (patch [b216d34](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/b216d346f1bdb561b37fdbaa5eff1543f8f56a1c))

### Changed

- Ignore spans by message after overrides. This allows overrides to modify error messages before ignoring them, allowing the override to cause the span to be ignored, or to prevent it from being ignored. (patch [64fde57](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/64fde57fff2eac98ea60539b62dc2197429d1139))

### Deprecated

- Deprecate `@appsignal/core` and `@appsignal/types` packages. Packages depending on these packages should be updated to use `@appsignal/javascript` instead. (minor [f9dd80c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/f9dd80c490a8cdab1d41441ad2ce502fc35c4934))

### Fixed

- Use returned span in override. Fix an issue where the span returned from an override function was not being used, instead using the original span. This led to confusing behaviour when the override created a new span instead of modifying the original one.

  To avoid breaking existing overrides that rely on modifying the original span without returning it, if the override function does not return a span, the original span will still be used.

  (patch [95e530c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/95e530c38243ac27060dd1daf3e75e91b54a7b1e))

## 1.5.0

_Published on 2024-11-28._

### Added

- Allow custom backtrace sanitization.

  > **Warning:** This is an advanced feature meant for specific use cases. For most use cases, you should not need this functionality. If in doubt, leave `matchBacktracePaths` unset.
  >
  > **Using `matchBacktracePaths` will cause public sourcemap detection to fail.** If using `matchBacktracePaths`, use our private sourcemap API to upload sourcemaps to AppSignal.

  Some applications, such as those running on Electron or React Native environments, emit backtrace lines containing paths relative to the device in which the application is running.

  The unpredictability of these backtrace line paths interferes with the correct functioning of backtrace error grouping, and makes it impossible to upload sourcemaps for these files using our private sourcemap API, as it is not possible to know the expected path beforehand.

  You can set the `matchBacktracePaths` configuration to a list of one or more regexes, which will be used to attempt to match the relevant section of the backtrace line path.

  For example, suppose you have an Electron application, which your users install at unpredictable locations. Your backtrace line paths may look something like this, with the username changing for each installation:

  ```sh
  /Users/${USERNAME}/Applications/CoolBeans.app/Contents/Resources/app/index.js
  ```

  To ignore these parts of the path that are not predictable, you can configure AppSignal to ignore everything before the `app` folder as follows:

  ```js
  const appsignal = new AppSignal({
    matchBacktracePaths: [
      new RegExp("CoolBeans\\.app/Contents/Resources/(.*)$")
    ]
  })
  ```

  If set, the `matchBacktracePaths` configuration option must contain a regular expression, or an array of one or more regular expressions, which attempt to match the whole backtrace line path. These regular expressions must have one or more match groups, such as `(.*)` in the example above, which attempt to match against the relevant segments of the backtrace line path.

  AppSignal will attempt to match the whole backtrace line path against these regular expressions in order. If any of the regular expression matches and produces a match group, AppSignal will replace the path in the backtrace line with the matched segment.

  Make sure your regular expressions provide unique and stable points of reference in the path, such as `CoolBeans.app/Contents/Resources` in the example above.

  (minor [7d9bf42](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/7d9bf427d5d29715a851590d09fba2e8a1e4725c), [d527ce3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/d527ce36d8f10d301276d36d80898143497e18e6), [ea9b9d3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/ea9b9d3dd12d8a20b159a4035519f10303f26248))

### Fixed

- Fix an issue when regexes with the `g` global flag are used on `ignoreErrors`. Before this change, after successfully matching on an error to ignore, if the following error would also match the same regular expression, the regular expression would then fail to match it. (patch [385e9c2](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-javascript/commit/385e9c2ff46e11e2f8489b63f582cc753d8206d3))
