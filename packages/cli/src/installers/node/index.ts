ðŸŽ‰ ${chalk.greenBright(
  "Great news!"
)} You've just installed AppSignal to your project!

The next step is adding your Push API key to your project. The best way to do this is with an environment variable:

${chalk.bold(`export APPSIGNAL_PUSH_API_KEY="${pushApiKey}"`)}

If you're using a cloud provider such as Heroku etc., seperate instructions on how to add these environment variables are available in our documentation:

ðŸ”— https://docs.appsignal.com/nodejs/configuration

Then, you'll need to initalize AppSignal in your app. Please ensure that this is done in the entrypoint of your application, ${chalk.cyan(
  "before all other dependencies are imported!"
)}

${chalk.bold(`const { Appsignal } = require("@appsignal/nodejs");

const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  active: true,
  name: "${name}"
});`)}

Need any further help? Feel free to ask a human at ${chalk.bold(
  "support@appsignal.com"
)}!
