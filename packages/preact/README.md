# `@appsignal/preact`

- [AppSignal.com website][appsignal]

The `@appsignal/javascript` integration for Preact v10.0.0-rc.0+ (Preact X). As Preact X is currently pre-release, you should also consider this pre-release functionality.

## Installation

Add the  `@appsignal/preact` and `@appsignal/javascript` packages to your `package.json`. Then, run `yarn install`/`npm install`.

You can also add these packages to your `package.json` on the command line:

```
yarn add @appsignal/javascript @appsignal/preact
npm install --save @appsignal/javascript @appsignal/preact
```

## Usage

### Error Boundary

If you are using Preact v10.0.0-rc.0+ or higher, you can use the `ErrorBoundary` component to catch errors from anywhere in the child component tree.

```jsx
import { Component } from 'preact'

import Appsignal from "@appsignal/javascript"
import { ErrorBoundary } from "@appsignal/preact"

const appsignal = new Appsignal({ 
  key: "YOUR FRONTEND API KEY"
})

const FallbackComponent = () => (
  <div>Uh oh! There was an error :(</div>
)

export default class App extends Component {
	render() {
    return (
      <ErrorBoundary 
        instance={appsignal} 
        tags={{ tag: "value" }} {/* Optional */}
        fallback={(error) => <FallbackComponent />} {/* Optional */}
      >
        { /** Child components here **/}
      </ErrorBoundary>
    )
  }
)
```

## Development

### Installation

This repository is a Lerna-managed monorepo, containing packages (located in the `/packages` directory) that map to separate `npm` modules.

To install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
lerna bootstrap
```

You can then run the following to start the compiler in _watch_ mode. This automatically compiles both the ES Module and CommonJS variants:

```bash
yarn build:watch
```

You can also build the library without watching the directory:

```
yarn build        # build both CJS and ESM
yarn build:cjs    # just CJS
yarn build:esm    # just ESM
```

### Testing

The tests for this library use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as the test runner. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the following command in the root of this repository to run the tests for all packages, or in the directory of a package to run only the tests pertaining to that package:

```bash
yarn test
```

### Versioning

This repo uses [Semantic Versioning][semver] (often referred to as _semver_). Each package in the repository is versioned independently from one another.

@TODO: define how this works once we know more about releasing
